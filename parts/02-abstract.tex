This paper presents a method for controlling multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This work uses an open source software from Virginia Tech called Building Energy Management Open Source Software (BEMOSS) to connect multiple IoT devices to one server. This server is run on a linux laptop and manage a variety of IoT devices. This papers work allows the use of BEMOSS on a Raspberry Pi, a cheap commercially available microcontroller, to run commands through BEMOSS. Currently BEMOSS supports a number of commercial IoT devices and in this work, a new device, a DC motor, has been implemented to be run on BEMOSS. Lastly a heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) control algorithm has been implemented to be later introduced onto BEMOSS.
